Project 3 Overview For project #3, I've created an app to assist in the table top game Space Kings. The app will allow a game master to keep track of a game and its characters for that game. 

the site is the protoType for a similar project that myself and a friend are working on of the same type. future iterations will include a deck of cards and functions that will allow the game to be played completely on the phone or computer. at the end of the project there will be much functionality and it will be very heavily javascript invested. the finished product will likely be done with ruby but I fell that my mern stack has been a major success as far as prototyping goes. Big Thanks to my instruction team and class mates for assisting in this project.
